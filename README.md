# Google Page Clone
This is the Week 1 project I've done with @SchoolOfCode, and it was initially build with only HTML and CSS.


### Refactoring

* Changed from CSS to SASS
* Changed importing Google Fonts Library
* Changed icons to SVG
* Clicking on the sign in button will show a picture
* All links working
* "I'm Feeling Lucky" button will go through an array of options
